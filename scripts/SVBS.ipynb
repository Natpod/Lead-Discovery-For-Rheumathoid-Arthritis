with no ligand, and JAK3 6dud with no ligand, the compound with a highest score achieved a minimized affinity of -9,-8.2,-7.9 kcal/mol respectively. The results are slightly and perciebably better for our new curated and screened candidate ligands, as they present more affinity for JAK1 than tofacitinib. However, disparity of affinity between the candidates docking in JAK1 and the docking in JAK2 and JAK3 was not as perciebable as with tofacitinib. As a matter of fact, affinity values for JAK2 were higher in the majority of the ligand candidates, possibly because of higher resemblance between JAK1 and JAK2 targets. The only potential candidate without this is CHEMBL78377, an experimental compound without recorded bioactivity for JAK1.\n","\n","(*) Docking was performed separately in the chimera software using a Vina executable. For this, models of the ligand and protein were saved in separate pdb files, and clicking on Tools>Structure Editing, the options AddH (adding hydrogens) and AddCharges (adding gasteiger charges) was used. After this, clicking on the Tools>StructureBinding>AutodockVina tool, one could specify the final docking file and executables. For the specification of the docking box and coordinates, the ones from MIT(C1) in the initial complete 3eig model were used, as they were considered a sufficient approximation of a centric coordinate in the drug binding site."]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.7.15"},"vscode":{"interpreter":{"hash":"6f43dff1d48f8d4483745e16bee0911d981d71c3bf8e2e9f0044ca76af06000c"}}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
